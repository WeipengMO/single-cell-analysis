## Notebooks

- [Single-cell best practices](./notebooks/) - This book teaches the best practices of single-cell sequencing analysis, from preprocessing to visualization to statistical evaluation and beyond. This book covers unimodal and multimodal single-cell sequencing data, with recommendations based on external benchmarks and reviews [[Link](https://www.sc-best-practices.org/preamble.html)].

- [Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/) This book teaches users how to use Bioconductor tools for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis. It covers various steps of typical workflows using example datasets and key concepts from the paper “Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor”. It aims to provide a solid foundation and a starting point for further exploration of scRNA-seq analysis. It is written for both experimental biologists and bioinformaticians.
